# Just Mono v2
A minimalistic Anki addon for making text monospace.

They have superscript and subscript, but not monospace? This addon fixes that.

Works with Anki 23.10+.

## Usage
- Select the text you want to mono-ify.
- 2 options:
  - Click the button "Add code" or press `Alt+X` to wrap the selection with `<code class="just-code">...</code>`.
  - Click the button "Add pre+code" or press `Alt+C` to wrap the selection with `<pre><code class="just-pre-code">...</code></pre>`.

## Customizing
- You can change the hotkey in the `config.json` file in your add-on folder.
