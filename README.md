# Just Mono
A minimalistic Anki addon for making text monospace.

They have superscript and subscript, but not monospace? This addon fixes that.

## Usage
1. Select the text you want to mono-ify.
2. Click the black square button or press `Alt+c`.

## Customising
- All monospace decorations (i.e. `<code>` tags) from this addon has a `just-mono` class. Do whatever you want with it.
- You can change the hotkey in the config.
